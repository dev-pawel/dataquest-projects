    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to analyse data from 6/49 lottery and answer questions like:\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning if we buy x tickets.\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five, four etc. winning numbers on a single ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The historical data set can be found here [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of results\n",
    "\n",
    "Winning the big price in 6/49 Lotto is extremely unlikely even if you buy a lot of tickets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to calculate probabilities using comtinations as in the 6/49 lottery, six number are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. Once the number is drawn, it's not put back in the set. Lets create a function to calculate combinations which we will be continously using. "
